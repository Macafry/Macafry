## Projects (In Progress)

Here are a few projects Iâ€™m currently working on.  
*Past project summaries are coming soon!*

### [Understanding Anxiety Through Data](https://macafry.github.io/Mental-Health-Analysis/) 
![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3?style=flat-square&logo=r) ![Data Visualization](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data_Visualization-blue?style=flat-square) ![Statistical Modeling](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statistical_Modeling-orange?style=flat-square) ![Data Mining](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data_Mining-9c27b0?style=flat-square) ![Reporting](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reporting_Insights-4caf50?style=flat-square)

- Modeled anxiety levels based on lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep, and diet using linear and logistic regression, identifying stress and sleep as the strongest predictors of anxiety. 
- Performed diagnostics to validate assumptions, check calibration, and ensure model reliability and interpretability.
- Communicated results through clear visuals and concise summaries tailored to non-technical audiences.


### [Learning Journal: Deep Learning from First Principles](https://macafry.github.io/Neural-Networks-Journal/)
